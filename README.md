# FeatureSelectionTensorFlow
Developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify microbiome communities into their respective taxonomic ranks (e.g., Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) based on sequencing data. The goal is to predict the correct taxonomic classification for each community in a given dataset.

# Data Inputs:
Features: Microbiome data represented by sequencing reads or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).

Labels: Taxonomic ranks for each sample, such as Kingdom, Phylum, Class, etc.

# Objectives:
Accuracy: The model should correctly classify as many samples as possible.
Precision: The model should minimize false positives for each taxonomic rank.
Recall: The model should minimize false negatives for each taxonomic rank.

# Challenges:
Class Imbalance: Certain taxonomic ranks might be overrepresented or underrepresented in the data, leading to class imbalance.
Data Complexity: Microbiome data can be highly dimensional and sparse, making feature selection and model training challenging.
Hierarchical Nature: The taxonomic ranks are hierarchical, meaning that errors at higher levels (e.g., Kingdom) may cascade down to lower levels (e.g., Species).

# Data Collection and Preparation Using QIIME2

1. Install and Set Up QIIME2:

Ensure you have QIIME2 installed on your system. You can install it using conda:

```
source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate

conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2023.9
```

2. Data Acquisition:

Sample Data: If you don’t have your dataset, QIIME2 provides sample data that you can use to get started. You can download it directly:

```
qiime tools import \

  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \

  --input-path emp-paired-end-sequences \

  --input-format EMPPairedEndDirFmt \

  --output-path paired-end-demux.qza
```

Own Data: If you have your own sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files), you can import it into QIIME2 following a similar process.

3. Data Preprocessing:

Demultiplexing: If your data isn’t demultiplexed, you’ll need to demultiplex the sequences to associate them with the correct samples:
bash

```
qiime demux emp-paired \

  --i-seqs paired-end-demux.qza \

  --m-barcodes-file sample-metadata.tsv \

  --m-barcodes-column BarcodeSequence \

  --o-per-sample-sequences demux.qza
```
Quality Control: Perform quality control using DADA2 to filter out low-quality sequences and generate feature tables:
bash

```
qiime dada2 denoise-paired \

  --i-demultiplexed-seqs demux.qza \

  --p-trunc-len-f 240 \

  --p-trunc-len-r 240 \

  --o-table table.qza \

  --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs.qza \

  --o-denoising-stats denoising-stats.qza
```

Assign Taxonomy: Assign taxonomy to your sequences using a pre-trained classifier (e.g., the Greengenes or SILVA databases):
bash

```
qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \

  --i-classifier gg-13-8-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza \

  --i-reads rep-seqs.qza \

  --o-classification taxonomy.qza
```
Export Data for Machine Learning: Export the feature table and taxonomy data for use in TensorFlow:

```
qiime tools export \

  --input-path table.qza \

  --output-path exported-feature-table

 

qiime tools export \

  --input-path taxonomy.qza \

  --output-path exported-taxonomy
```

Convert to CSV: Convert the QIIME2 outputs to a CSV format that TensorFlow can ingest:

```
biom convert \

  -i exported-feature-table/feature-table.biom \

  -o feature-table.csv \

  --to-tsv

 

qiime tools export \

  --input-path taxonomy.qza \

  --output-path taxonomy.tsv
```

4. Data Labeling:

The taxonomy.tsv file will contain the taxonomic classifications for each sequence, which will serve as the labels for your model.

5. Data Splitting:

Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. You can do this using pandas in Python:
python

```

import pandas as pd

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = pd.read_csv('feature-table.csv', sep='\t', index_col=0)

labels = pd.read_csv('taxonomy.tsv', sep='\t', index_col=0)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
